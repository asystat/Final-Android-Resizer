Final Android Resizer
==============

A simple yet powerful resizer for Android developers
--------------

I started this project because I was sick of resizing all resources for my Android projects.
The <a href="http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/index.html">Android Assets Studio</a> gives resized images one by one and it takes forever. 

There is another very similar project <a href="https://code.google.com/p/9patch-resizer/">here</a> but it didn't fit my needs (only accepts png, does not have all densities, one-by-one resizing)


With **Final Android Resizer** you are able to:

- Select starting density
- Automatically set output folder where your main image is located 
- Resize several images at once (Drag & Drop)
- Select output densities (ldpi, mdpi, tvdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- Preserve the image format (jpg,png)
- Option to select output directory (mipmap or drawable)
- Option to select if want to overwrite file

I have not tried resizing 9patch images yet.
