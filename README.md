Xamarin Image Resizer
==============
A simple yet powerful resizer for Xamarin developers
This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/asystat/Final-Android-Resizer">Final Android Resizer</a> which has been updated to accomodate iOS and Windows folders. Please visit the original project if you want to donate to say thank you, I just did a quick hack over the top of it to support additional folders/

Feel free to commit changes and submit Pull Requests, I won't be actively maintaining this (except when me/my team requires it to be updated), but I will happily allow other people to keep improving it if it helps the community.

With **Xamarin Image Resizer** you are able to:

- Select starting density
- Select res directory for each platform, so you don't have to move the resized files
- Resize several images at once (Drag & Drop)
- Select output densities (ldpi, mdpi, tvdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi, 1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x, windows(Windows is equivalent to xxhdpi/4x))
- Preserve the image format (jpg, png)
- Option to select output directory on Android (mipmap or drawable)
- Option to select if want to overwrite file

As with the original author, I have not tried resizing 9patch images yet.
